- Fix code workspace_name


Jupyter notebooks:
1. Transient Simulation
2. Analytics (parallel part)
3. Wavespeed errors (same network TNET3)

Follow everything in the paper:
Put everything in the same Jupyter notebook, plots match SI
valve opening, pump turn-on (if no bugs)
change parameters in closed surge-tank
add variable demand (show demand in the junction)
remove leak

add Analytics (separate notebook)

Mention how analytics functionalities work in the paper (single processor works on all machines, but parallel only in Linux)

fix closed surge tank and play with the water level so that the response is not the same
