<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps. PTSNET can be downloaded via pip

### Installation

We highly encourage using a conda environment for the installation, so that dependencies such as OpenMPI don't have to be manually installed.

* Install conda

  ```sh
  # Linux
  https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html
  ```
  ```sh
  # Windows
  https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html
  ```
* Install the conda environment with all the necessary dependencies

  1. Download the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/gandresr/ptsnet/blob/development/requirements.txt)
  2. In the command line `cd` to the location where the requirements.txt file was downloaded
  3. Execute `conda create -n ptsnet` to create a new conda environment
  4. Activate the environment with `conda activate ptsnet`
  5. Install the requirements using `conda install --file requirements.txt`
  6. Install h5py
      - For __Linux/Mac__: `conda install "h5py>=2.9=mpi*"`
      - For __Windows__: `conda install h5py`
  7. Install PTSNET: `pip install ptsnet`


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Create a file called named `simulation.py` with the following contents:

```python
from ptsnet.simulation.sim import PTSNETSimulation
from ptsnet.utils.io import get_example_path

sim = PTSNETSimulation(
  workspace_name = 'TNET3_VALVE',
  inpfile = get_example_path('TNET3'))
sim.define_valve_operation('VALVE-179', initial_setting=1, final_setting=0, start_time=1, end_time=2)
sim.run()
```

After creating the file, you can execute the code from the command line.

#### To execute the parallel version of PTSNET it is necessary to have __Linux/Mac__</span>. 

If you have __Linux/Mac__ execute the following command on the terminal:
```sh
mpiexec -n 4 python simulation.py
```
The number of processors is defined by the parameter `-p` in the command, in this case 4.

If you have __Windows__ you can still run the simulation as shown below, but you will not have access to PTSNET's parallel capabilities:
```sh
python simulation.py
```
For more examples, please refer to the [jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/gandresr/ptsnet/tree/development/publication).
