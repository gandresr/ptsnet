## Publication Results

In this folder you will find two Jupyter Notebooks, which contain test cases for PTSNet's functionalities.

The file `main.ipynb` contains examples to setup, execute, and extract information for various types of transient simulation with PTSNet.

The file `analytics.ipynb` contains examples of analytics functionalities to estimate simulation times, number of processors, and wave speed error for a specific simulation.

The folder *HAMMER* contains Hammer v8i files that were used to compare simulation results for valve closure, pump shut-off, and burst simulations on the TNET3 example.

The folder *RESULTS* contains summarized results to compare transient simulations that were executed with Hammer v8i, TSNET, and PTSNET.
